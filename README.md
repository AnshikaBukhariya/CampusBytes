Smart Token Canteen System-
To design and implement a token-based canteen automation system that enhances the efficiency of order management by reducing wait times, minimizing human errors, and improving customer experience. The system aims to automate the ordering process by generating unique digital for each transaction, enabling customers to track their orders without standing in long queues. Additionally, it seeks to streamline kitchen operations by providing a structured and organized approach to order fulfillment, reducing congestion at the counter, and ensuring timely service. The solution will also incorporate cashless payments, real-time order status updates, and integration with existing canteen infrastructure to create a seamless and user-friendly experience.
